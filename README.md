## HandsUp revolutionizes charity with yield return donations, empowering users to multiply their generosity. ðŸ™Œ

Everyone wins due to the yield technology. Help your friends, family, and other charitable causes make something meaningful with this money.

1. What do we change?

Everything related to donations.

Lock your money, and get it all back whenever you decide, and donate to your favorite charity project with the yield generated from the staked money.

2. Why?

Donations need to be censorship-free, secure, simple, and cheap.

That's what we fix.

3. How does it work?

Instead of directly giving your money, you can make it work for X time for others in a charitable purpose.

Each contribution will be sent into secure DeFi protocols, and the donation recipient will receive the yield return daily.

Once the lock is over (the lock time is chosen by the contributor in the process), the contributor will get back the full amount of their assets. They can also choose liquid yield donation, meaning they can withdraw at any time.

Of course, the donor is able to choose classic donations.
